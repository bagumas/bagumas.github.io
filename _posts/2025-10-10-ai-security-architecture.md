AI is rewriting how organizations think about security architecture.
It’s no longer enough to secure infrastructure — we must secure intelligence itself.

Over the past months, I’ve been refining a Context-Driven AI Security Architecture Review Template (v1.0) to help teams build trustworthy, resilient, and compliant AI systems.

Here’s a condensed view of the framework 👇

## 1️⃣ Context-Driven Architecture

Define before you design.
- Identify data classification, deployment model (on-prem, SaaS, hybrid, edge), integration points, and regulatory context (GDPR, CCPA, EU AI Act).
- Categorize model risk (predictive vs generative) based on business criticality.

## 2️⃣ Identity & Access Management

- Enforce SSO + MFA for all privileged accounts.
- Define RBAC for ML engineers, curators, reviewers, and operators.
- Manage API keys via Vault/KMS — no hard-coded credentials.

## 3️⃣ Data Security

- Encrypt everything (TLS 1.2+, AES-256).
- Apply data minimization and privacy-enhancing techniques (DP, anonymization).
- Filter sensitive prompts/outputs to prevent leakage.

## 4️⃣ Model Security

- Sign and verify model artifacts before deployment.
- Assess adversarial threats (prompt injection, poisoning, model theft).
- Integrate red teaming, bias evaluation, and explainability.

## 5️⃣ Infrastructure Security

- Adopt Zero Trust and micro-segmentation between training and inference.
- Secure containers, GPUs, and IaC pipelines.
- Patch AI frameworks and dependencies continuously.

## 6️⃣ MLOps / Secure SDLC

- Embed OWASP ML/LLM Top 10 in your dev cycle.
- Automate code and model scanning in CI/CD.
- Require peer review and security sign-off before release.

## 7️⃣ Monitoring & Logging

- Centralize telemetry in SIEM.
- Capture inference anomalies and model drift.
- Alert on abuse patterns (prompt injection, scraping).

## 8️⃣ Third-Party & Compliance

- Validate vendor AI security posture (SOC 2, ISO 27001, AI RMF).
- Map AI systems under regulatory frameworks (EU AI Act, HIPAA, PCI, GLBA).
- Maintain data processing agreements and human oversight.

The outcome?
✅ Resilient AI systems.
✅ Traceable accountability.
✅ Defensible security posture under global AI regulations.

AI Security Architecture isn’t about adding controls — it’s about designing trust from day one.

Would you integrate such a review checklist in your org’s AI governance process?
I’d love to hear how other teams are formalizing AI security reviews.
