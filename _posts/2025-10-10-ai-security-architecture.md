AI is rewriting how organizations think about security architecture.
It‚Äôs no longer enough to secure infrastructure ‚Äî we must secure intelligence itself.

Over the past months, I‚Äôve been refining a Context-Driven AI Security Architecture Review Template (v1.0) to help teams build trustworthy, resilient, and compliant AI systems.

Here‚Äôs a condensed view of the framework üëá

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Context-Driven Architecture

Define before you design.
- Identify data classification, deployment model (on-prem, SaaS, hybrid, edge), integration points, and regulatory context (GDPR, CCPA, EU AI Act).
- Categorize model risk (predictive vs generative) based on business criticality.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Identity & Access Management

- Enforce SSO + MFA for all privileged accounts.
- Define RBAC for ML engineers, curators, reviewers, and operators.
- Manage API keys via Vault/KMS ‚Äî no hard-coded credentials.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Security

- Encrypt everything (TLS 1.2+, AES-256).
- Apply data minimization and privacy-enhancing techniques (DP, anonymization).
- Filter sensitive prompts/outputs to prevent leakage.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Security

- Sign and verify model artifacts before deployment.
- Assess adversarial threats (prompt injection, poisoning, model theft).
- Integrate red teaming, bias evaluation, and explainability.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Infrastructure Security

- Adopt Zero Trust and micro-segmentation between training and inference.
- Secure containers, GPUs, and IaC pipelines.
- Patch AI frameworks and dependencies continuously.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ MLOps / Secure SDLC

- Embed OWASP ML/LLM Top 10 in your dev cycle.
- Automate code and model scanning in CI/CD.
- Require peer review and security sign-off before release.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring & Logging

- Centralize telemetry in SIEM.
- Capture inference anomalies and model drift.
- Alert on abuse patterns (prompt injection, scraping).

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Third-Party & Compliance

- Validate vendor AI security posture (SOC 2, ISO 27001, AI RMF).
- Map AI systems under regulatory frameworks (EU AI Act, HIPAA, PCI, GLBA).
- Maintain data processing agreements and human oversight.

The outcome?
‚úÖ Resilient AI systems.
‚úÖ Traceable accountability.
‚úÖ Defensible security posture under global AI regulations.

AI Security Architecture isn‚Äôt about adding controls ‚Äî it‚Äôs about designing trust from day one.

Would you integrate such a review checklist in your org‚Äôs AI governance process?
I‚Äôd love to hear how other teams are formalizing AI security reviews.
