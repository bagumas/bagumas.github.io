As organizations race to integrate AI into their products, **security often lags** behind ‚Äî leaving critical models, data, and APIs vulnerable.
Here‚Äôs a **practical baseline checklist** to secure your AI systems from the ground up:

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Host & Infrastructure Security
- Use **CIS-hardened images** and keep OS + dependencies **patched**.
- Minimize installed software ‚Äî reduce your attack surface.
- Restrict inbound traffic and **only allow HTTPS (443)**.
- Enable **system monitoring, auditing, backups, and endpoint protection**.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Container Security
- Use **trusted runtimes** (e.g., Docker) and keep them **up to date**.
- Leverage **user namespaces** for isolation.
- Continuously scan container images for vulnerabilities.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Network & API Protection
- Enforce **TLS 1.3** for secure data-in-transit.
- Apply **rate limiting + firewall rules** between services and inference APIs.
- Use **OAuth2 + API keys** for authentication.
- Encrypt models with **AES-256** and verify integrity using **SHA-256**.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Access & Identity Controls
- Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** via OS permissions or cloud IAM.
- Follow **least privilege principles** to limit unnecessary access.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Code & Model Security
- Apply **SAST, SCA**, and **secret scanning** in CI/CD pipelines.
- Regularly **scan Jupyter notebooks** for vulnerabilities.
- Save models safely (**Keras H5, Hugging Face Safetensor**) ‚Äî **avoid Pickle** due to RCE risks.
- Use tools like modelscan to check models for embedded threats.


**Bottom line**: AI security isn‚Äôt just about securing data ‚Äî it‚Äôs about **protecting models, infrastructure, and APIs** end-to-end. Starting with these **baseline controls** will help reduce risks before scaling.
