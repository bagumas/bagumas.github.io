As organizations race to integrate AI into their products, security often lags behind ‚Äî leaving critical models, data, and APIs vulnerable.

This guide defines a baseline to secure your AI systems from the ground up.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Host & Infrastructure Security
- Use CIS-hardened images and keep OS + dependencies patched.
- Restrict inbound traffic, enforce HTTPS, and enable endpoint protection.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Container Security
- Use trusted runtimes like Docker.
- Enable continuous vulnerability scanning.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Network & API Protection
- Enforce TLS 1.3.
- Use OAuth2 + API keys for authentication.
- Encrypt models with AES-256 and verify integrity using SHA-256.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Access & Identity Controls
- Implement RBAC or cloud IAM.
- Enforce least privilege.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Code & Model Security
- Apply SAST/SCA scanning in CI/CD.
- Use modelscan to detect malicious model content.
- Avoid Pickle ‚Äî prefer Keras `.h5` or Hugging Face Safetensors.

**Bottom line:** AI security is end-to-end ‚Äî from data pipelines to inference APIs.
