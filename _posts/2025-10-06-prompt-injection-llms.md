🛡️ #6 — Adversarial Prompt Attacks on LLMs
Part 6 of my 7-part series on securing AI systems.
Large Language Models (LLMs) bring incredible capabilities — but they’re also vulnerable to prompt-based adversarial attacks, where carefully crafted inputs manipulate the model into breaking rules or leaking sensitive information.

⚠️ Common Prompt Attack Methods
Prompt Injection — Insert malicious instructions into user input, tricking the model into following attacker goals.


Jailbreaking — Craft prompts that bypass safeguards (e.g., role-play exploits like the “grandma story”), leading to inappropriate or unsafe outputs.


Prompt Override — Inject competing objectives that override system instructions, sometimes causing denial-of-service in multi-turn contexts.


Indirect Injection — Hide adversarial prompts inside web pages or documents that the LLM ingests.


Data Exfiltration — Extract memorized sensitive data from model responses or chat history.


Impersonation — Instruct the LLM to adopt a new identity and ignore prior safety rules.



🛡️ Defenses & Mitigations
Securing against prompt attacks is a shared responsibility between LLM platforms and application builders.
LLM Provider Controls:
Content filtering, red-teaming, and regular safety updates.


Privacy-preserving training practices to minimize memorization.


Application-Level Controls:
Input sanitation & validation before sending prompts.


Prompt engineering to enforce boundaries and context.


Moderation APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face) for real-time filtering.


Secure output encoding to prevent code execution or injection.


Guardrails frameworks (e.g., NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails, WhyLabs, Robust Intelligence) for advanced input/output filtering.



💬 Question for you: Have you tested your LLM applications for prompt injection risks? If yes, what defenses worked best?
