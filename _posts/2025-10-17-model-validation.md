After weeks of integrating Jenkins + MLflow + Docker, I now have a fully automated **AI Model Validation Framework** running end-to-end.

✅ **CI/CD pipeline**: Triggers model training, evaluation, and policy-driven validation.
✅ **MLflow integration**: Logs performance (F1, latency p95, PII risk) for every model build.
✅ **Policy gates**: Automatically halt promotion if thresholds fail (e.g., fairness, privacy, robustness).
✅ **Reproducibility**: Each run version-tracked with Git SHA and metadata for traceable ML governance.

The latest run shows:

🎯 F1 = 1.0000 ⚡ Latency p95 = 72 µs 🛡️ PII Leak Rate = 0

This setup lays the groundwork for what’s next: integrating LLM-specific guardrails (prompt-injection detection, jailbreak resilience, and ethical refusal validation).

🔒 From here, my focus shifts toward AI security baselining — where predictive accuracy meets trustworthy AI principles.

💡 Would love feedback from others building ML validation pipelines or exploring AI security automation — what metrics or checks have been most valuable in your workflows?
