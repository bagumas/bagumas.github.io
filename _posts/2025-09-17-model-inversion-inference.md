While model extraction steals the **model**, inversion and inference attacks aim to steal the data — often the most sensitive asset an organization has.

## ⚠️ Why it matters
- **Data breaches & privacy violations** (e.g., reconstructing patient records).
- **Regulatory risk** (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).
- **Reputation damage** from exposing user information.



## 🧠 Attack types
1️⃣ **Model Inversion**– Reconstructs training data from predictions.
- **Exploit confidence scores**: attackers iteratively adjust inputs to approximate original data.
- **Generative inversion**: use GANs to recover blurred/masked images by refining outputs until they resemble realistic samples.

2️⃣ **Inference Attacks** – Deduce sensitive information without direct data/model access.
- **Attribute inference**: learn global properties (e.g., average age of a dataset).
- **Meta-classifier**: train a surrogate to imitate target behavior using data from a similar distribution.

3️⃣ **Membership Inference**– Determines whether a record was in the training set (e.g., health status, preferences). Often succeeds against overfit models that memorize data.

## 🛡️ Defenses
- **Limit model output**: return top-1 predictions (argmax), not full probability vectors.
- **Access control & rate limiting**: throttle suspicious queries; use gated API patterns.
- **Regularization & augmentation**: reduce overfitting to prevent memorization.
- **Privacy-preserving ML**: apply **differential privacy**, data minimization, anonymization.
- **Monitoring & alerting**: track unusual query patterns via SIEM/ML observability tools.



💬 Question for you: Have you ever tested your deployed models for privacy leakage (e.g., membership inference)? If yes, which defenses held up best?
