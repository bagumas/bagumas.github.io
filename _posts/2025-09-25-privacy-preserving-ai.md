Privacy-preserving AI is about **protecting sensitive data while still extracting valuable insights** from it. This ensures models are trained, deployed, and used without compromising individual privacy.
A core principle here is **data minimization (GDPR)** ‚Äî only collect and process the minimum data required to achieve a specific function.
## üîπ Key Techniques
### Basic Anonymization
- Remove unnecessary sensitive fields
- Mask or replace identifiers with placeholders/hashes
- Add random noise to numeric values (obfuscation)

### Advanced Anonymization
- **K-anonymity**: Ensures each record is indistinguishable from k others
- **Microaggregation**: Replace values with group averages
- **Spatial aggregation**: Generalize locations into regions or partial postal codes
- **Geocoding**: Convert coordinates into generalized labels (e.g., what3words)

### Rich Media Anonymization
- **Blurring, pixelation, masking** (OpenCV)
- **Data perturbation**: Transform pixels to obscure identity
- **Face replacement or GAN-generated synthetic images**
- **Audio/Video**: Voice alteration, background noise, speech-to-text and back

### Differential Privacy (DP)
- Ensures outputs remain ‚Äúinsensitive‚Äù to any single record‚Äôs presence
**Techniques include**:
- Input perturbation: Noise added to raw data
- Objective perturbation: Noise in the optimization function
- Output perturbation: Noise in model outputs

### Federated Learning
- Data stays at the source
- Only model weights/updates are shared and aggregated
- Reduces data exposure, supports compliance


### Split Learning
- Neural network split between client and server
- Client processes data up to a ‚Äúcut layer,‚Äù sends outputs only
- Raw data never leaves device ‚Üí stronger privacy



‚úÖ In short: Privacy-preserving AI enables organizations to balance **innovation with compliance** while safeguarding individuals‚Äô rights.
