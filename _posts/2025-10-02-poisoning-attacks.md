#🚨 2: Poisoning Attacks — When Hackers Train Your AI
In the second post of my 7-part series on securing AI systems, I dive into poisoning attacks — how attackers compromise AI models before deployment and what organizations can do to defend against them.

Most people focus on securing deployed AI models, but attackers often strike before deployment — during the training phase. This is where poisoning attacks come in.
These attacks subtly manipulate training data to compromise the model’s learning process and influence predictions at inference time.

🎯 Why Attackers Poison AI Models
Induce bias → Skew model decisions in their favor


Insert backdoors → Secret triggers that force misclassification


Disrupt operations → Degrade model performance


Enable fraud & evasion → Avoid detection by security systems


Ransom & sabotage → Compromise model integrity for leverage


Example use cases:
Manipulating sentiment analysis to flip negative reviews to positive ones


Evading fraud detection systems


Mislabeling spam emails so they bypass filters



🛠️ Types of Poisoning Attacks
1️⃣ Label Flipping
 Attackers insert mislabeled records into training data — simple but effective.
2️⃣ Backdoor Poisoning (high impact)
Attackers insert a hidden trigger into training data


At inference, any input containing the trigger gets misclassified


Example: Embedding a small cyan square in an image → model classifies it as “safe” every time


Tools: Adversarial Robustness Toolkit (ART) supports SinglePixelBackdoor, Checkerboard Patterns, and Image Insert Poisoning


3️⃣ Clean Label Attacks (harder to detect)
Training data appears normal but is intentionally manipulated


Labels remain correct, making detection challenging


ART supports FeatureCollisionAttack and PoisonAttackCleanLabel for testing defenses



🛡️ Defending Against Poisoning Attacks
Access control → Apply least privilege to datasets & training pipelines


Data protection → Encrypt, hash, and version training datasets


Model integrity → Hash models and validate signatures before deployment


Data validation → Check data lineage, detect anomalies, and continuously monitor


Adversarial testing → Use ART & TextAttack to simulate poisoning scenarios


Adversarial training → Train with clean labels to improve model robustness


MLOps best practices:


CI/CD for models & data


Automated versioning


Continuous monitoring & rollback



Bottom line:
 Poisoning attacks are one of the biggest blind spots in AI security today. Protecting your training data pipelines is just as important as securing inference APIs.
