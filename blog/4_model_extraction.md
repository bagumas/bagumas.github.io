# 🔎 Model Extraction — Stealing the Model

Attackers query deployed APIs to replicate models, leading to IP loss and privacy risks.

## 🧠 Techniques
- Query-based distillation.
- Copycat learning.
- Membership inference.

## 🛡️ Defenses
- Limit output (return top-1 predictions).
- Enforce rate limits & access control.
- Add noise (Differential Privacy).
- Use watermarking for ownership proof.

**Bottom line:** Protect models as digital IP assets.
