# 🧬 Model Inversion & Inference Attacks

These attacks reconstruct or infer sensitive training data — exposing privacy risks.

## ⚠️ Attack Types
- **Model Inversion:** reconstructs inputs from model outputs.
- **Attribute Inference:** deduces hidden data traits.
- **Membership Inference:** checks if a record was in the training set.

## 🛡️ Defenses
- Limit probability outputs.
- Use regularization to reduce memorization.
- Apply differential privacy.
- Monitor API queries for anomalies.

**Bottom line:** Protect both model and data — they’re equally valuable.
